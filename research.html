				<p><b>Social Learning in a Network Model of COVID-19</b><br>

					<div> This paper studies the effects of social learning on the transmission of Covid-19 in a network model. We calibrate our model to detailed data for Cape Town, South Africa and show that the inclusion of social learning improves the prediction of excess fatalities, reducing the best-fit squared difference from 20.06 to 11.28. The inclusion of social learning both flattens and shortens the curves for infections, hospitalizations, and excess fatalities. This result is qualitatively different from flattening the curve by reducing transmission probability
						through non-pharmaceutical interventions. While social learning reduces infections, this alone is not sufficient to curb the spread of the virus because learning is slower than the disease spreads. We use our model to study the efficacy of different vaccination strategies
					and find that a risk-based vaccination strategy–vaccinating vulnerable groups first–leads to a 50% reduction in fatalities and 5% increase in total infections compared to a random order benchmark. By contrast, using a contact-based vaccination strategy reduces infections by 9% but results in 64% more fatalities relative to the benchmark. </div>

				<p><b>Do Firms Have a Preference for Paying Exactly Zero Tax?</b><br>

					<div> Understanding firms’ responses to corporate tax rates is crucial for optimal tax design; particularly so for developing countries,which rely more heavily on corporate income taxes. We study administrative data on the taxable income of distribution small businesses in South Africa, around three prominent “kink points” with discontinuous marginal tax rate changes. There is substantial and persistent bunching at the two higher income kink points, with associated implied elasticities between 0.2 and 0.3. Bunching at the lowest kink (where marginal tax rates change from 0% to 7%) appears qualitatively different, with firms seemingly treating moving across this kink as leading to a substantial discrete shift in the level of taxes due (i.e., treating this kink as a “notch”). This is consistent with a preference to avoid
					paying a positive tax bill. We provide evidence against several natural explanations for this behavior, including hassle factors ormisperceptions of the tax schedule. </div>

				<p><b>The Cape of Good Homes: The Cape of Good Homes: Exchange Rate Depreciations, Foreign Demand and House Prices</b><br>

					<div> Emerging markets are characterized by frequent periods of large and unexpected exchange rate depreciations. These events create opportunities for foreign investors to purchase domestic assets at a discount, especially if these assets have sticky prices. We show this to be the case in the housing market in Cape Town, South Africa. Using property transaction data, I find that foreign non-residents buy more properties following large exchange rate depreciations—in the lower quartile of month-on-month changes. I find no evidence of a similar effect for other buyers, suggestive of strong exchange rate-related motives. Using these depreciations as demand shocks to foreign non-resident buyers, I find that this increased demand leads to an increase in house prices of 3.39%. I find that foreign non-resident buyers pay 10.42% more than other buyers for otherwise identical properties and that this tendency to pay a premium accounts for around 27% of the observed causal impact of foreign demand on house prices. </div>

				<p><b>Diffuse Bunching with Optimization Frictions: Theory and Estimation (Draft available on request) </b><br>
				<details> <summary>Abstract</p></summary>
				<br>
				<div> This paper presents a parsimonious model in which a continuum of taxpayers face discrete income adjustment opportunities. The model predicts continuous observable income densities which match key features of empirical income histograms around kinks and notches in the tax schedule, including diffuse bunching and positive mass above tax notches. We analytically characterize the income distribution distortions produced by kinks and notches as a function of the elasticity of taxable income and a single other parameter---the average distance between adjacent income adjustment opportunities---which can be jointly estimated from empirical distributions using maximum likelihood methods. This method does not require the analyst to specify bounds on a bunching window or (in the case of a notch) a dominated income region in order to implement the estimation. We apply this method using administrative tax data from South Africa, estimating moderate elasticities between 0.2 and 0.4 at higher incomes, and large elasticities in excess of one at low incomes. We find strong evidence that firms with paid tax practitioners adjust their incomes more precisely in response to tax incentives, although we do not find a consistent pattern of income elasticities across this dimension of heterogeneity. We compare our results to estimates using a conventional bunching estimator based on a model of continuous income adjustment, which suggests that accounting for adjustment frictions results in higher estimated income elasticities. </div>
